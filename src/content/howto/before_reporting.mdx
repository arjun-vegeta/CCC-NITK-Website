# Step-by-step guide for troubleshooting network issues before registering a complaint at NITK.

Before registering a network issue, please follow these steps to diagnose the problem. This will help in faster resolution and minimize downtime.

---

## **Step 1: Check Physical Connectivity**
- Verify that the **LED indicators** on the network port of your computer are **glowing**.
- If LEDs are **not glowing**, try the following:
  - Ensure the **network cable is securely plugged in** at both ends (your computer and the wall jack).
  - Remove and replug the cable.
  - If the issue persists, contact a **vendor** to check and replace the cable.

If the **LEDs are glowing**, proceed to Step 2.

---

## **Step 2: Verify IP Configuration**
To check if your **IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS entries** are correct:

### **For Windows Users:**
1. Open **Command Prompt** (Win + R → type `cmd` → press Enter).
2. Type: `ipconfig /all`
3. Note down your **IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers**.

### **For Linux Users:**
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Type: `/sbin/ifconfig` or `ip a`
3. Check the assigned **IP details**.

### **For macOS Users:**
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Type: `ifconfig | grep inet`
3. Look for your **IP address** under `en0` or `en1` (depending on whether you are using Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

If the IP settings are incorrect, reconfigure them as per the guidelines provided in the **NITK Network Setup Guide**.

---

## **Step 3: Ping Test**
Try to **ping nearby devices** and network nodes to check connectivity:

1. Open **Command Prompt / Terminal**.
2. Type: `ping x.x.x.x` (replace `x.x.x.x` with a known working IP address in your building).
3. If the ping **succeeds**, proceed to Step 4.
4. If the ping **fails**, check your IP configuration again or contact **network support**.

---

## **Step 4: Check Connection to the Gateway**
Try **pinging the building’s switch**:
- The **switch details** are available in the **NITK Network Configuration Guide**.
- If you can **ping the switch**, proceed to **gateway testing**.

To **telnet the gateway**, type:
```
telnet x.x.x.x
```
(replace `x.x.x.x` with your **gateway’s IP address** as per NITK guidelines).

If you **cannot reach the gateway**, register a network issue online.

---

## **Step 5: Register a Network Complaint**
If all the above steps fail, submit a complaint with the test results:
- Mention whether you **checked the cable, verified IP settings, ran ping tests, and attempted telnet**.
- This helps in resolving your issue faster.

Register your complaint at: **[NITK Network Complaints Page](http://network.nitk.ac.in/complaints)** *(Update the actual URL when available)*.

## **Important Notices**

1. **Check if your IP is blocked**
   - Regularly verify if your machine is generating **suspicious traffic** at:
     [http://network.nitk.ac.in/blockip](http://network.nitk.ac.in/blockip) *(Update the actual URL when available)*.
   - If your IP is blocked, scan your device for malware and apply the latest security patches.

2. **CCC’s Responsibility**
   - CCC is responsible for network issues **up to the building switch**.
   - Issues beyond the switch (e.g., within your computer or room cabling) are **your responsibility**.
   - Contact external vendors for assistance if needed.

3. **New Network Cabling**
   - Any modifications or new cabling setups **must be approved** by CCC before implementation.

4. **Security Recommendations**
   - Keep your system updated with the **latest patches** and **antivirus software**.
   - Avoid using unauthorized software that may cause network disruptions.

For further assistance, contact the **NITK Network Helpdesk** at **+91-824-2473085**.
