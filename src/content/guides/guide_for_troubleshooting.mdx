# Step-by-step guide for troubleshooting network issues before registering a complaint at NITK.

>
 **Note:** This guide is meant **only for students**.  
**Faculty members** should directly email their issue to:  
**notifyccc@nitk.edu.in**

Before registering a network issue, please follow these steps to diagnose the problem. This will help in faster resolution and minimize downtime.

## **Step 1: Check Physical Connectivity**
- Verify that the **LED indicators** on the network port of your computer are **glowing**.
- If LEDs are **not glowing**, try the following:
  - Ensure the **network cable is securely plugged in** at both ends (your computer and the wall jack).
  - Remove and replug the cable.
  - If the issue persists, contact a **vendor** to check and replace the cable.

If the **LEDs are glowing**, proceed to Step 2.

## **Step 2: Verify IP Configuration**
To check if your **IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS entries** are correct:

### **For Windows Users:**
1. Open **Command Prompt** (Win + R → type `cmd` → press Enter).
2. Type:
<CodeBlock>ipconfig /all</CodeBlock>
3. Note down your **IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers**.

### **For Linux Users:**
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Type:
<CodeBlock>/sbin/ifconfig</CodeBlock>
or
<CodeBlock>ip a</CodeBlock>
3. Check the assigned **IP details**.

### **For macOS Users:**
1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Type:
<CodeBlock>ifconfig | grep inet</CodeBlock>
3. Look for your **IP address** under `en0` or `en1` (depending on whether you are using Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

If the IP settings are incorrect, reconfigure them as per the guidelines provided in the **NITK Network Setup Guide**.

---

## **Step 3: Ping Test**
Try to **ping nearby devices** and network nodes to check connectivity:

1. Open **Command Prompt / Terminal**.
2. Type:
<CodeBlock>ping x.x.x.x</CodeBlock>
(replace `x.x.x.x` with a known working IP address in your building).
3. If the ping **succeeds**, proceed to Step 4.
4. If the ping **fails**, check your IP configuration again or contact **network support**.

---

## **Step 4: Check Connection to the Gateway**
Try **pinging the building’s switch**:
- The **switch details** are available in the **NITK Network Configuration Guide**.
- If you can **ping the switch**, proceed to **gateway testing**.

To **telnet the gateway**, type:
<CodeBlock>telnet x.x.x.x</CodeBlock>
(replace `x.x.x.x` with your **gateway’s IP address** as per NITK guidelines).

If you **cannot reach the gateway**, register a network issue online.

---

## **Step 5: Register a Network Complaint**
If all the above steps fail, submit a complaint with the test results:
- Mention whether you **checked the cable, verified IP settings, ran ping tests, and attempted telnet**.
- This helps in resolving your issue faster.

## **Important Notices**


1. **CCC’s Responsibility**
   - CCC is responsible for network issues **up to the building switch**.
   - Issues beyond the switch (e.g., within your computer or room cabling) are **your responsibility**.

2. **New Network Cabling**
   - Any modifications or new cabling setups **must be approved** by CCC before implementation.

3. **Security Recommendations**
   - Keep your system updated with the **latest patches** and **antivirus software**.
   - Avoid using unauthorized software that may cause network disruptions.


For further assistance, contact the **NITK Network Helpdesk** at **+91-824-2473085**.
