## Steps to Install and Configure OpenVPN on Linux

1. Login to the Sophos user-portal with your captive portal credentials at  
   **vpnportal.nitk.ac.in** from an external network (i.e., outside NITK network).

2. Click on **Download configuration for other OSs** under the SSL VPN tab (visible only if VPN access is enabled for you).

3. Install OpenVPN:  
   For Ubuntu, run:  
   <CodeBlock>sudo apt install openvpn</CodeBlock>

4. Run the OpenVPN command:  
   <CodeBlock>sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/XXXX__ssl_vpn_config.ovpn</CodeBlock>  
   - `XXXX__ssl_vpn_config.ovpn` is the file downloaded from the Sophos portal.  
   - Move it to `/etc/openvpn/` or use the correct path.  
   - `XXXX` is your employee code or user ID.

5. For OpenVPN 2.4.x and later, edit the `.ovpn` file:  
Change `comp-lzo no` to `comp-lzo adaptive` and reconnect.


✅ Done! (All done via shell prompt)
