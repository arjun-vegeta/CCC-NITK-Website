# MATLAB Campus-wide License at NITK

The **Central Computer Centre (CCC) at NITK Surathkal** has facilitated the **MATLAB campus-wide license**, ensuring **seamless access** to MATLAB, Simulink, and its companion toolboxes for faculty, researchers, and students.

## **Core Features**
- **Campus-wide access** under the **Total Academic Head Count (TAHC) model**.
- Available for **faculty, researchers, and students** on both university and personal devices.
- **Support for specialized toolboxes**, including **Machine Learning, AI, Image Processing, and Control Systems**.

## **Benefits & Advantages**
- **Unlimited access** with no individual licensing costs.
- **Latest software updates** with continuous improvements.
- **Seamless integration** into coursework, research, and simulations.
- **MATLAB Online support**, enabling web-based access.
- **Cloud-based collaboration tools** for research and project development.

## **Installation & Access**
1. **Visit the official MATLAB portal**: [http://matlab.nitk.ac.in](http://matlab.nitk.ac.in).
2. **Follow the installation guidelines** provided.
3. **Activate the license** using the **NITK registered email ID**.

## **Why It Stands Out?**
- Enhances **learning, innovation, and research** across engineering and scientific fields.
- Enables **real-world problem-solving** using MATLABâ€™s extensive computational tools.
- Provides a **future-ready academic environment** with cutting-edge technology.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Expansion of MATLAB training programs** for students and faculty.
- **Integration with cloud-based AI platforms** for advanced research.
- **Enhanced remote learning support** with additional online resources.

NITK ensures that its community stays at the forefront of **engineering and computational advancements** through this initiative. ðŸš€
