# Data Centre & Server Infrastructure

The **NITK Data Centre**, housed in the **CCC Ground Floor**, is a state-of-the-art facility that serves as the backbone of the instituteâ€™s digital infrastructure.

## **Core Features**
- **Integration hub for OFC backbone**, ensuring high-speed data transfer and seamless connectivity.
- **Houses Internet connections to BSNL & NKN** along with associated networking equipment.
- **Enterprise-grade virtualization** using **Blade Servers** with:
  - **VMWare** for efficient resource management.
  - **Proxmox Virtualization** on **Dell/Lenovo Servers** for flexible cloud and hybrid deployments.
  - **Ubuntu System containerization** for scalable and lightweight applications.
- **Eight new high-performance servers** added to enhance computing power.
- **Critical backbone network services** accessible from both inside and outside the network.

## **Performance & Reliability**
- **Highly redundant and failover-ready architecture** for maximum uptime.
- **Optimized server resource allocation** for computational workloads and academic research.
- **Supports critical services** such as web hosting, databases, and cloud applications.

## **Security & Scalability**
- **Enterprise-class firewalls and intrusion detection systems** ensure data security.
- **Future-ready infrastructure** with room for scalability and performance upgrades.
- **Dedicated power backup solutions** to prevent downtime during outages.

## **Why It Stands Out?**
- Among the **most advanced academic data centers in the country**, supporting research, AI, and cloud computing.
- **Essential for high-end computing tasks**, big data processing, and student projects.
- Provides the backbone for **seamless academic, administrative, and research operations** at NITK.

## **Future Upgrades**
- Expansion with **Smart Racks and AI-powered monitoring**.
- **Green computing initiatives** for energy-efficient server management.
- Increased computational power for **machine learning, simulations, and advanced research**.
